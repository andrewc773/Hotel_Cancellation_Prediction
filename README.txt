You can find the dataset used <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset?select=Hotel+Reservations.csv">here/>.

I used libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy in python, in this project.

This project will perform logistic regression to predict whether or not a customer is going to honor their hotel reservation, or cancel, given the features in the dataset.

Working with this dataset taught me about the benefit of adding polynomial features to mitigate bias, the importance of scaling features, and ways to effectively communicate and display performance metrics for classification algorithms, such as with K-fold cross validation.
